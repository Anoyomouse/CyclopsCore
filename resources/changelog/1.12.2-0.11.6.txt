Additions:
* Create ru_ru.lang

Fixes:
* Limit packet handler channel names to 20 characters
  This is because Forge packets in some places assume a max channel name string of 20 characters,
  but this is not validated at init time.
  This caused strange crashes where mod packets were being identified as vanilla packets.
  Closes CyclopsMC/IntegratedDynamics#569
