As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!

Lib changes:
* Throw exception instead of warning on lost ingred during movement
  This fixed the problem where items could silently go lost
  in Integrated Tunnels network upon movement failures.

Lib additions:
* Add getter for scroll position in GuiScrollBar
