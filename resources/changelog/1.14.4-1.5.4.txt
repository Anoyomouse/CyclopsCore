As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!

Lib Additions:
* Add LazyOptional-based DefaultCapabilityProvider constructor
* Allow configurable properties to have custom named ids
  This is important in cases where multiple instances of config classes
  are created, and only one instance of a config property is needed.

Lib Changes:
* Make CyclopsTileEntity implement IDirtyMarkListener
* Make scrollRelative public in scrollbar widget
* Make scrolling containers extend from inventory containers
* Loosen world interface for cube detectors
* Allow item capabilities to be registered to item instances

Fixes:
* Fix internal capabilities not being invalidated
* Fix scrolling inventories showing one row too many
* Fix rare CubeDetector crash when spam-clicking
* Fix scrolling guis not being able to scroll
* Fix mod compats never loading
  This commit removes the ability to disable compats from the config file
  because Forge loads config files too late to make this possible.
